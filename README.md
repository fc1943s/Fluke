# Fluke

Heavily inspired by:
- The [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)
- The [Commonplace Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) and [Bullet Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Journal) concepts
- Excel
- Vim
- All the Task/Bookmark Managers and Habit Trackers online that don't meet my nutty needs ðŸ˜‚


Some features planned:
- Quantum-safe data encryption
- Vivaldi integration (via browser.html JavaScript injection or Chrome extension) to sync bookmarks
- Telegram integration (fast link sharing)
- YouTube playlists integration
- Spotify playlists integration
- Filmow lists integration
- Trakt lists integration
- Mobile responsive layout (with maybe full apps later)


This is my attempt to show that the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/) rocks!


Why Fluke? Because there will be many randomization possibilities to make everything fun. That is probably one of the last things I will implement though. More on that later.

### Known Issues

- Using private data before adding database support (so you probably can't build it yet).
- I'm still not sure this is the best way to add paket git dependencies.
